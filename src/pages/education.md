FAQ: {
    'What is a neurodiversity profile?' : 'A neurodiversity profile is how a child thinks about, feels, and perceives the world. It is unique to them. It explains an individual’s experiences, traits, strengths, and difficulties and makes recommendations based on the child’s fundamental ways of being, that are tailored specifically to help them and their environment. It is not a personality test or a behavioural assessment and the neurodiversity profiling tool is not a personality profiling tool.',
    'What does a neurodiversity profile involve?' : 'The actual process of a neurodiversity profile depends on the child and the circumstances. For example, we may agree that doing part or all of it in writing or face to face is best. Effectively, the process involves Aspiedent gathering as much relevant information about an individual as possible, usually through guided discussion. We then analyse the data to find what underlying issues need to be accounted for when making decisions regarding the child and their support. Aspiedent then creates a detailed but clear explanation of the child’s profile and how this interacts with their environment. The profile report then gives a series of general, educational, and child-specific recommendations. Implementing these will achieve maximum fulfilment in the child’s life.',
    'How long does a neurodiversity profile take?' : 'It will only require about half a day from the child we are profiling and their family and/or professionals. It takes about two weeks from the actual data-gathering exercise to turn around a completed neurodiversity profile report. As this is a very hands-on process for us, the current wait times from your enquiry to the neurodiversity profile appointment is up to 4 weeks.',
    'Does my child need to have a diagnosis of a neurodiverse condition?' : 'No, a child does not need to be diagnosed with a neurodiverse condition like autism to take our neurodiversity profile. We understand that some parents do not want to seek a diagnosis for their child for many reasons. We also understand that depending on where you live, getting a diagnosis can be problematic, because of both how a child is treated once they have been diagnosed and because the health services aren’t always equipped to give an accurate/timely diagnosis. A child’s need for help does not diminish as they wait for a diagnosis, even if you wish to pursue one.',
    'What is the difference between a neurodiversity profile and a personality profile?' : 'Unlike a personality profile or specialist assessment, a neurodiversity profile is a scientific approach to understanding fundamental underlying issues that affect a child rather than their personality traits. For example, the underlying issues may include slow processing of incoming information, different hyper and hypo sensitivities, or differences in visual perception. These underlying issues derive from five key areas found in neurodiversity: processing, sensory, executive function, cognitive (thinking), and emotion.',
    'Will a neurodiversity profile cost me?' : 'The value of a neurodiversity profile when needed far outweighs the cost. Aspiedent will provide you with a quote for the service once we know more about your situation and if we believe that the value of the profile will be significant to you and your family. A profile can cost between £1000-£3000 depending on specific needs.',
    'What happens after my child’s neurodiversity profile has been completed?' : 'We need to understand a child’s profile before we can recommend any next steps. However, what happens next is completely up to you and your family. In some cases, you may feel confident enough with the information you have received in the neurodiversity profile that you don’t need any further guidance. For those who would like to receive further support from us, there are several ways we can help, such as helping you access disability benefit payments or helping with your child’s education.'
