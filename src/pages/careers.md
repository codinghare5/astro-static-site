FAQ: {
    'What is a neurodiversity profile?' : 'A neurodiversity profile is how you think about, feel, and perceive the world. It is completely unique to you. It explains your experiences, traits, strengths, and difficulties and makes recommendations based on your/the person’s fundamental ways of being and is tailored specifically to help you and your career. It is not a personality test. The neurodiversity profiling tool is not a personality profiling tool. Each individuals mind is a very complex puzzle that has lots of connections going all over, our job, as part of the profiling tool, is to gather the pieces together as a whole, and making it make sense.',
    'What does a neurodiversity profile involve?' : 'The actual process of a neurodiversity profile depends on you and your circumstances. For example, we may agree that doing part or all of it in writing or face to face is best. Effectively, the process involves Aspiedent gathering as much relevant information about you as possible, usually through guided discussion. We then analyse the data to find what underlying issues need to be accounted for when making educational or career choices. We then create a detailed but clear explanation of your/the individuals profile and how this interacts with their working environment. The profile report then gives a series of general, educational, and career-specific recommendations. Implementing these will help you to achieve maximum success in working life.',
    'How long does a neurodiversity profile take?' : 'Currently, a neurodiversity profile takes around three days of work or more to complete. However, it will only require about half a day with the person we are profiling and their family or friends. It takes about two weeks from the actual data-gathering exercise to turn around a completed neurodiversity profile report. We can book you in for an autism profile within a month of your enquiry.',
    'Do I need to have a diagnosis of a neurodiverse condition?' : 'No. We understand that some people do not want to seek a diagnosis for personal reasons. Also, getting a diagnosis can be problematic depending on where you live. An individual’s need for help does not diminish as they wait for a diagnosis, even if they are willing to pursue one.',
    'What is the difference between a neurodiversity profile and a personality profile?' : 'Unlike a personality profile, a neurodiversity profile is a scientific approach to understanding fundamental underlying issues that affect a person rather than their personality traits. For example, the underlying issues may include slow processing of incoming information, different hyper and hypo sensitivities, or differences in visual perception. These underlying issues derive from five key areas found in neurodiversity: processing, sensory, executive function, cognitive (thinking), and emotion.',
    'Will a neurodiversity profile cost me?' : 'Yes. However, the value of a neurodiversity profile when needed far outweighs the cost. Aspiedent will provide you with a quote for the service once we know more about our situation and if we believe that the value of the profile will be significant to the individual.',
    'What happens after my neurodiversity profile has been completed?' : 'We cannot say what exactly will happen after a neurodiversity profile. We need to understand a person’s profile before we can recommend any next steps. However, some people can run with the recommendations and move on straight away. For others, we may recommend specific training or support from us or others based on the report outcome.'
