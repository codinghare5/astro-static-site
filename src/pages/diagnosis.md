FAQ: {
    'What is a neurodiversity profile?': 'A neurodiversity profile is how an individual thinks about, feels, and perceives the world, and it is unique to them. It explains an individual’s experiences, strengths, difficulties, and more and makes recommendations based on that particular person’s fundamental ways of being. It is not a personality test, and the Neurodiversity Profiling tool is not a personality profiling tool.',
    'What does a neurodiversity profile involve?': 'The actual process of a neurodiversity profile depends on you and your circumstances. For example, we may agree that doing part or all of it in writing or face to face is best. Effectively, the process involves Aspiedent gathering as much relevant information about you as possible, usually through guided discussion. We then analyse the data to find what underlying issues need to be accounted for when making life choices. We then create a detailed but clear explanation of your profile and how this interacts with the world and others around you. The profile report then gives a series of specific recommendations. Implementing these will help you to fulfil your potential in life.',
    'How long does a neurodiversity profile take?' : 'Each neurodiversity profile is unique to the individual. We require about half a day from the person we are profiling (and sometimes some close friends and family members) to gather information. As this is a very hands-on process for us, it takes about two weeks from the actual data-gathering exercise to turn around a completed neurodiversity profile report. The current wait time from your enquiry to the neurodiversity profile appointment is up to four weeks.',
    'Do I need to have a diagnosis of a neurodiverse condition?' : 'No, you do not need to be diagnosed with a neurodiverse condition to take our neurodiversity profile. Anyone, even if they do not feel they have an undiagnosed neurodiverse condition, can do the profile. We understand that some people do not want to seek a diagnosis for personal reasons. We understand that depending on where you live,  getting a diagnosis can be problematic, both because of how you are treated once you receive a diagnosis and because the health services aren’t always equipped to give an accurate/timely diagnosis. An individual’s need for help does not diminish as they wait for a diagnosis, even if they are willing to pursue one.',
    'What is the difference between a neurodiversity profile and a personality profile assessment?' : 'Unlike a personality profile or other psychological profile test, a neurodiversity profile is a scientific approach to understanding fundamental underlying issues that affect a person rather than their personality traits. For example, the underlying issues may include slow processing of incoming information, different hyper and hypo sensitivities, or differences in visual perception. These underlying issues derive from five key areas found in neurodiversity: processing, sensory, executive function, cognitive (thinking), and emotion.',
    'How much does a neurodiversity profile cost?': 'The value of a neurodiversity profile far outweighs the cost. Aspiedent will provide you with a quote for the service once we know more about your situation and if we believe that the value of the profile will be significant to the individual. A profile can cost between £1000-£3000 depending on specific needs.',
    'What happens after I have received my completed neurodiversity profile?' : 'What happens next is completely up to the individual. In some cases, the individual may feel confident enough with the information they have received in the neurodiversity profile that they don’t need any further guidance. For those who would like to receive further support from us, there are several ways we can help, such as getting access to disability benefit payments or helping you reach personal goals.'}
