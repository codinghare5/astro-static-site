FAQ: {
    'What is a neurodiversity profile?' : 'Neurodiversity profiling is a system that can be applied to anyone. Through answering a set of questions, an individual and the company will receive a set of recommendations to help the business derive maximum benefit from the profiled employee. It is not an employee personality profile test and the neurodiversity profiling tool is not a personality profiling tool. A neurodiversity profile is how an individual thinks about, feels, and perceives the world, and it is unique to them. It explains an individual’s experiences, strengths, difficulties, and more. We can then make recommendations based on that particular person’s fundamental ways of being.',
    'What does a neurodiversity profile involve?' : 'The actual process of a neurodiversity profile depends on the individual and the circumstances. For example, we may agree that doing part or all of it in writing or face to face is best. Effectively, the process involves Aspiedent gathering as much relevant information about the employee/s and the employee as possible. Aspiedent then analyses the data to find what underlying issues need to be accounted for when making workplace related decisions. We then create a detailed but clear explanation of the individual’s profile and how this interacts with their working environment. The profile report then gives a series of specific recommendations. Implementing these will help employers derive maximum benefit from their employees.',
    'How long does a neurodiversity profile take?' : 'It will only require about half a day from the person we are profiling and their employer. The neurodiversity profiling is a very hands-on process for Aspiedent and it takes about two weeks from the actual data-gathering exercise to complete a neurodiversity profile report. The current wait times from your enquiry to the neurodiversity profile appointment is up to 4 weeks.',
    'Does the employee need to have a diagnosis of a neurodiverse condition?' : 'No. We understand that some people do not want to seek a diagnosis for personal reasons. Anyone, even if they do not feel they have an undiagnosed neurodiverse condition, can do the profile. We understand that depending on where you are located,  getting a diagnosis can be problematic, both because of how an individual is treated once they receive a diagnosis and because the health services aren’t always equipped to give an accurate/timely diagnosis. An individual’s and employer’s need for help does not diminish as the individual waits for a diagnosis, even if they wish to pursue one.',
    'What is the difference between a neurodiversity profile and a personality profile assessment?' : 'Unlike a personality profile or other psychological profile test, a neurodiversity profile is a scientific approach to understanding fundamental underlying issues that affect a person rather than their personality traits. For example, the underlying issues may include slow processing of incoming information, different hyper and hypo sensitivities, or differences in visual perception. These underlying issues derive from five key areas found in neurodiversity: processing, sensory, executive function, cognitive (thinking), and emotion.',
    'How much does a neurodiversity profile cost?' : 'The value of a neurodiversity profile far outweighs the cost. Aspiedent will provide you with a quote for the service once we know more about your situation and if we believe that the value of the profile will be significant to the individual and the organisation. A profile can cost between £2000-£5000 depending on specific needs.',
    'What happens after the neurodiversity profile has been completed?' : 'What happens next is completely up to the individual and the employer. In some cases, the individual and employer may feel confident enough with the information they have received in the neurodiversity profile that they don’t need any further guidance. For others, we may recommend specific training or support based on the report outcome. For those who would like to receive further support from us, there are several ways we can help, such as employee leadership development training or management training.'
