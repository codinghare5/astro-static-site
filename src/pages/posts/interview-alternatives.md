The key problem many autistic people have in finding a job is poor
interview skills. But are we recruiting for someone who can do the job,
or someone who can perform well at interviews?

**Are interviews always fit for purpose?**

If we think about it, do we really consider what are we actually
recruiting for when we interview people? What skills we need?

Have you ever wondered how somebody in a senior position got where they
were, even though they are frankly useless at their job? Unfortunately,
I certainly have!

Perhaps we have all come across charismatic people who could blag their
way through any interview process, but who would be a colossal waste of
money if hired.

On the other hand, what happens to the skilled people who become
tongue-tied at interview, but who are extremely conscientious and would
make sure they did all of their work to a top standard?

If recruiting somebody to go to job interviews all day, on time, and wow
a panel, then yes, perhaps interviewing them alone is the best method of
recruiting them. But how many jobs require somebody to ace interviews
all day?

Doesn't it make sense to ensure that a person can actually do the job
they are being recruited for?

Let's say you are recruiting for an administrator. How can you ensure
that the candidate can complete administration tasks to a high standard
and fit into the team, by just asking them to explain to you why or how
they can, in an interview?

Karen on Facebook tells me that she can do all sorts of things, but it
does not mean that she can (bad joke, sorry).

**Ways to make sure you are hiring an asset and not a problem.**

Honestly, it will take some initial (but worthwhile) work if you are a
small company without huge assessment centres or a HR department, and
you may need some help from us. But if you are recruiting, why not start
with creating a set of tasks for people to do, to demonstrate they have
the skills to do the job?

For example, if teamworking is a key requirement, then get candidates to
work in teams -- but on a realistic task and while making sure the team
they will be working with are involved.

Believe it or not, one autistic job seeker we were helping went for a
job as a librarian and was expected to engage in an exercise involving
surviving an aeroplane crash. This did not involve finding a survival
manual in the library.

How on earth was this exercise relevant to the job? We certainly cannot
explain why -- and neither could the autistic adult. He did not get the
job because he could not work out how to engage in what was to him a
pointless and unrealistic exercise.

Perhaps it would have been better to have a team exercise that involved
an everyday task in the library. I.e. An exercise applying the
cataloguing and shelving system to a set of books all of which could
potentially be shelved in several different places.

There are methods to help you devise tasks that test for a set of
competencies. Indeed, we could help you with this.

Virtually all jobs say they want good communication skills. But why so?
Do your candidates need good social skills, or simply to be able to
understand what has been asked of them to do and/or the ability to
explain what they have done?

**Employing Autistic People**

It is a huge myth that all autistic people will excel at a few
restricted skills, such as computer programming or boring and repetitive
tasks. During our work advising employers, we have come across autistic
people who:

-   can easily recognise fraud in financial data
-   are brilliant at understanding a large and complex database
-   are brilliant at taking a huge body of written information and
    analysing it so it can be presented in a way that is easy to
    understand
-   are brilliant at sales (yes, sales!)
-   are brilliant at both the back-end design of a system and at
    creating an intuitive user interface (this combination is extremely
    rare and valuable)
-   can tell what is wrong with a motor engine by listening to it
-   are whizzes at learning new software in an area that is familiar to
    them

Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to ascertain these skills at
interview, and often they only come to light when the person is carrying
out their duties! But that is where Aspiedent can help.

If you would like to know how to tap into the talents of autistic people
(which also works for non-autistic people) - whilst ensuring you are
fulfilling your duties as a good, non-discriminatory manager or
employer, please contact us.
