Autism is an umbrella term for a myriad of different underlying
difficulties unified by a set of common symptoms. The symptoms primarily
include difficulties with social interaction, difficulties with
communication, and difficulties making and maintaining friendships with
other people.

Along with these symptoms you have to have a number of other
difficulties that fall under the umbrella of Restricted and Repetitive
Interests and Behaviour. These include sensory issues, difficulties with
change and rigid thinking, stereotypical behaviours such as hand
flapping, and very strong interests which exclude other activities.

It turns out that if you have these other difficulties sufficiently
severely then the main symptoms will be met.

The difficulties that underpin autism relate to something that has 'gone
wrong' with the development of the brain. We have to use the term 'gone
wrong' with caution. Many autism activists claim that there is nothing
wrong with them and that they are just different.

In many cases they are right. They enjoy their world and find the lack
of acceptance in society a problem. Other autistic people are frustrated
by their autism and to them it is a problem -- although sometimes as
well as the difficulties there are 'differences' that

Confused? Well you are not alone.

Everyone who works with autism recognises that each person's autism is
different. But when it comes to researching autism, there is a strange
assumption that autism is a homogeneous condition with a single
underlying cause. This fits the notion that autism ranges from mild to
severe. So there are a number of competing theories as to what cause
autism such as:

-   **Sensory issues**, which significantly affect how somebody relates
    to the world. This includes senses that are too sensitive or not
    sensitive enough. So for example one person might not be able to
    stand background noise, while another person needs it. Or someone
    might not be able to separate out a conversation from background
    noise. Some autistic people have quite esoteric sensory experiences
    such as experiencing a sequence of numbers as a colourful landscape
    or experiencing the world as no more than patterns of colour and
    shape.

-   **Weak central coherence** which refers to

-   Executive functioning

-   Theory of mind

-   Monotropism

-   Processing issues

With the exception of Theory of Mind, which is probably best labelled as
a symptom rather than a cause all are correct -- and all are wrong.

All are correct because each describes the underlying cause for some
autistic people. All are wrong because none describe the underlying
cause of all autistic people. Many autistic people have several of these
difficulties.

At Aspiedent we work out which underlying difficulties cause an
individual's autistic symptoms. We cut through the confusion to describe
each individual's autism and make specific recommendations that are
specifically tailored to their autism.

I am so confused! What actually IS autism?
==========================================

I get asked this question all the time. And it is a perfectly good
question. But actually, Autism is just not something that can be defined
easily.

**Autism is an 'Umbrella Term' **

Autism is an umbrella term for a whole range of different underlying
difficulties, unified by a set of common symptoms. The symptoms mainly
include:

A.  Difficulties with social interaction

B.  Difficulties with non-verbal communication (e.g. understanding
    facial expressions), and

C.  Difficulties making and maintaining friendships with other people.

Along with the above symptoms, to be diagnosed with autism, you have to
have some other difficulties that fall under the umbrella of 'Restricted
and Repetitive Interests and Behaviour'. These include:

D.  Sensory issues

E.  Difficulties with change and rigid thinking

F.  Stereotypical behaviours such as hand flapping or rocking, and

G.  Very strong interests which exclude other activities.

If the difficulties of D, E, F, G are sufficiently severe then the main
symptoms (A, B and C) will be met.

The difficulties that underpin autism relate to something that has 'gone
wrong' with the development of the brain. We have to use the term 'gone
wrong' with caution. Many autism activists claim that there is nothing
wrong with them and that they are just different.

In many cases they are right. Some autistic people enjoy how they
experience the world and how their brain works and find the lack of
acceptance in society a problem. However, other autistic people are
frustrated by their autism and to them it is a problem. To others autism
is severely disabling. Although, just to make it more complicated,
sometimes as well as their difficulties many autistic people recognise
they also have 'differences' that are useful.

Confused? Well you are not alone.

Everyone who works or knows people with autism recognises that each
person's autism is different. But when it comes to researching autism,
there is a strange and totally mistaken assumption that Autism is a
SINGLE condition with a SINGLE underlying cause.

This means that there is a belief that the label 'autism' fits into the
notion that autism simply ranges from mild autism to severe autism.

**Coincidentally, there are several competing theories as to the
*causes* of autism. Briefly:**

**Sensory issues** which significantly affect how somebody relates to
the world. This includes senses that are too sensitive or not sensitive
enough. So for example, one person might not be able to stand background
noise, while another person needs it. Or someone might not be able to
separate out a conversation from background noise. Some autistic people
have quite unusual sensory experiences such as experiencing a sequence
of numbers as a colourful landscape or experiencing the world as no more
than patterns of colour and shape!

**Weak central coherence**. This refers to an inability to see the
bigger picture, to understand things in different contexts, or to put
visual information together effectively.

**Executive functioning.** An umbrella term for the brain's ability to
effectively master skills such as organisation, problem solving,
planning and execution and inhibition. This features in Dyspraxia and
ADHD too.

**Theory of mind,** which is the notion that autistic people simply lack
empathy and that the reason they do not fit in is because they lack to
ability to metaphorically 'step into somebody else shoes.'

**Monotropism.** This is a fancy word for the ability to focus intensely
on one thing at a time, and the inability to take in anything outside of
this! Think Rain Man.

**Processing issues.** For example, when a person's brain only processes
information very slowly (meaning you can tell them a joke and it will
take until the next day for them to understand the joke and laugh), or
when someone is asked to buy milk, eggs and bread, that they get so
caught up on associations with milk (milk-\>cows-\>fields-\>pleasant
walks in the countryside -\>their last holiday) that they don't register
the rest of the list at all!

With the exception of Theory of Mind - which is probably best labelled
as a symptom rather than a cause -- it is correct that all the above are
valid explanations of somebody's autism, but also all are not!

**Correct,** because each describes the underlying causes of autism for
**some autistic people. **

**Incorrect,** because none describe the underlying cause of autism for
**all autistic people**.

Many autistic people have a combination of several of these
difficulties, and some have just one or two!

The aim of this post was to outline how far from a homogeneous condition
autism is, and to make the point that when we say 'autism', we are
referring to a vast array of different underlying difficulties which all
fall under the label of 'autism'. The thing that unites them are the
symptoms described at the top of this blog, which form the diagnostic
criteria!

At Aspiedent we work out which underlying difficulties cause an
individual's autistic symptoms. We cut through the confusion to describe
each individual's autism and make specific recommendations that are
specifically tailored to their autism.
