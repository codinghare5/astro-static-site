Recently, a high-performing autistic employee contacted me in desperate
need of workplace support that catered specifically for her autism.

She was one of (if not the) most profitable salesperson in her
organisation. But she had recently been diagnosed with autism after a
mental breakdown. The new knowledge that her difficulties in life were
because she was autistic had completely shaken her world.

With her consent (let's call her Sam), I contacted Sam's manager and HR
Department on her behalf to try and organise her an autism specific
Workplace Assessment.

The response I got back from HR was: "*I would like to let you know that
if we do decide to organize a workplace assessment for Sam, we will
likely instruct an occupational health expert to carry out this step*.".

OK, fine. It was not my call. But is Occupational Health the right
approach for autism?

**Occupational Health Assessments Vs Autism Workplace Assessments**

If you have spent time in any reasonably sized organisation, you will
have likely heard of Occupation Health. This is a service that can
assess the health and wellbeing of an employee, and make recommendations
regarding whether an employee is well enough to undertake their job
role.

If a disabled or chronically unwell employee can, with reasonable
adjustments, undertake their role, Occupation Health Professionals can
suggest adjustments that might help them to do this.

In theory.

But I knew in my heart of hearts that in her case, Sam needed a vastly
different approach than what she would have got with an Occupation
Health Assessment.

It could be the difference between Sam losing her job & the company
losing a valuable employee, and Sam becoming an even more profitable
employee than she already was.

I am not suggesting that Occupational Health experts are not any good,
nor that Occupational Health Assessments should be made redundant and
cannot help autistic employees. But in some circumstances, it would be
far more cost effective and helpful for an autistic person to have an
Autism specific Workplace Assessment.

I have lost count of number of times we have been called into workplaces
as a last resort to do an Autism Workplace Assessment for an autistic
employee, when the initial Occupational Health Assessment (which the
company would be also paying for), was not useful. What a waste of
precious time and money!

Why is it a waste of money? Well, let us look at some differences
between Occupation Health Assessments and for example, an **Aspiedent
Autism Workplace Assessment**.

**Occupational Health Assessments**

A standard Occupational Health Assessment is mainly centred around an
employee's capacity to work. It is about finding what reasonable
adjustments can be made for a disabled or unwell employee from the
medical model perspective (the idea that a disabled person is disabled
solely because of their disability), and not because 'society' cannot
cater for differences.

I still struggle to understand who exactly 'society' is. But perhaps
that is for a different blog.

An Occupation Health Assessment does not traditionally take into account
that the employee may be working towards promotion and what this would
mean for them, going forwards. And usually, there is little if any real
*understanding* of autism/neurodiversity.

**Autism/Neurodiversity Workplace Assessment**

In comparison, an Autism Workplace Assessment enables the employee and
their managers to understand the particular manifestation of the
autism/neurodiversity in the individual in question.

It is about identifying strengths and weaknesses, and then finding ways
to use strengths to overcome weaknesses. In terms of suggested
reasonable adjustments and aids, this is approached from a combination
of the medical and social model perspectives.

It can account for promotion requirements and help the individual and
managers to develop a plan to achieve promotion.

But how do you know you are choosing the right specialist company that
offers autism and neurodiversity specific Workplace Assessments for
employers and employees?

This is difficult, because how is a manager who is looking for help and
support with an autistic employee, because they are brave enough to
admit they do not understand autism, know whether the organisation they
choose really understands autism?!

As the saying goes you don't know what you don't know!

Below are some hints and tips that will potentially save time, money and
having to pay for a service twice because it did not help the first
time.

**Choosing a provider: What to look out for**

There are many disability generalists and even specialist autism or
neurodiversity companies who will come in and do a Workplace Assessment
for an autistic employee. You would have thought that these all provided
a service that can confidently resolve and improve the situation. Alas,
this is not always the case.

For example, Mind mapping (or spider diagram) software is often
recommended for autism. But this is not *always* appropriate. Mind
mapping software is useful for those who start with the bigger picture
and need help drilling down to the detail.

We once did a Workplace Assessment for an autistic employee for whom
this had been recommended to help with his writing. But this was
completely inappropriate for him, because he started with the detail and
worked up to the bigger picture.

Aspiedent were instead able to recommend alternative software that was
suitable for him, but which is not known to most organisations who do
Workplace Assessments, because it is not marketed as disability support
software.

Essentially, support software for neurodiverse employees is not a
panacea: we often recommend other simpler solutions, depending on the
situation. Sometimes these solutions are then rolled out across the
organisation and they help everybody!

So to conclude, **what should you consider when choosing which
organisation to choose to do a Workplace Assessment that will be of
value?** What questions should you be asking? Well, here are three.

1.  Does the assessor first establish the particular underlying autistic
    or neurodiverse difficulties of the particular employee?

2.  Is there a problem-solving process in order to find the best
    solutions for the employee and the employer that are tailored to the
    actual workplace?

3.  Do software solutions come from a wide list of software and not just
    recognised support software?

For Aspiedent, the answer to all these questions is a resounding YES!
