description: Some employers feel they have an autistic employee who struggles to accept authority. This got us thinking about why an employer might get this impression of an autistic employee. This blog post explores what might be going on, and how to deal with it.

As an HR consultant or manager, you may sooner or later be managing an
employee who is on the autistic spectrum. You (or they) may not even
know they are autistic. 

As well as many benefits, this will sometimes come with challenges that
can make you feel frustrated and unsure of what to do. 

I recently spoke to an HR Consultant contact who was updating employment
contracts for a tech company. As skilled as she was, she was being
completely side-tracked by a particular employee who disputed every
written word of his 'updated' contract. 

He had been told his contract had not changed. It was just not the same
'word for word' as his old one. 

The misunderstanding here was that there were no real material changes
to his contract of employment. But to the (likely autistic) employee, it
had changed because, well, the words had changed! 

It reminded me that simple misunderstandings due to how different people
think can cause major grievances that can last (and I have witnessed
them lasting) several months. This is not good for employees nor
employers and best to be avoided. This is why **Aspiedent's Workplace Assessments** are so
valuable. We often come in once, point out the misunderstandings,
provide the solutions and leave. Job done. 

Other commonly encountered issues for HR Professionals when dealing with
neurodiverse employees include:

**The employee is overly precise, appears critical**

Aspiedent has come across cases where managers have a headache because
an employee keeps pointing out all of their fellow colleague's mistakes
and making corrections. Their identification of other's mistakes is
interpreted by their colleagues as arrogant.

But, if you look at it from the autistic perspective, the employee in
question simply sees mistakes that they think need fixing and is
genuinely trying to help when they point out the mistakes! 

In this instance, the manager may just need to spell out to the autistic
employee why other colleagues may not appreciate this, and/or implement
a system in which employees can discreetly pick out mistakes and fix
them, without embarrassing other employees.  

An autistic person might get very frustrated with their managers because
they are not correcting other colleague\'s mistakes all the time. They
might even think this is sloppy management. This can cause lots of
anguish to the autistic employee and upset the harmony of the
workplace. 

However, because of the autistic person's limited understanding of the
social world and of non-autistic people, they may just need some
training to understand their manager's perspective. 

In turn, what managers may need to appreciate, is that the autistic
person themselves would rather be corrected constantly for their
mistakes, and therefore does not understand why it may irritate others!

Having said this, occasionally an autistic person's ability to spot
mistakes is invaluable. For example, such a person could be invaluable
in a fraud department, where their ability to spot errors and
inconsistencies in data would be a real asset to their business.

**The employee struggles to accept authority or criticism, especially when they think authority does not understand their job**

A while ago, we encountered an employee in the public sector who was
regularly in dispute with his managers over what the right or wrong
answer was to external requests for information.

This was interpreted as the employee not accepting authority, nor
criticism about his ability to do his job. Perhaps even as a 'Know it
all'. 

Actually, it was simply the employee misinterpreting the questions. He
was therefore trying to answer a totally different question to what his
manager thought he was answering. 

Easy solution: we advised the managers to check this employee had the
same understanding of the questions as they did before they argued about
the answers. 

This is just one example but there are many instances where it may
appear an employee appears to reject authority when it is just a
misunderstanding, or a different interpretation of the facts.

**The Employee wants to do things all their way**

This is an interesting one as it can cause a lot of interpersonal
problems for autistic people at work. 

It is not unheard of for people with autism to drive their employers up
the wall because of their regular suggestions for different ways of
doing things. 

An autistic person can sometimes see where a process or procedure could
be completed much more efficiently, but then really struggle to
comprehend why some employers do not want their employees to be getting
involved in changing things that others have become comfortable with,
even if they are less productive.

This may be because autistic people are less likely to understand the
often subtle, political aspects of their workplace. For example, a
manager fearing they may lose their position should a new and more
efficient way be found to do things (perhaps particularly in the public
sector). Or a manager's allegiance with a particular employee which
results in that employees' ideas being given more notice than ones from
other members of the team.

On the other hand, an autistic employee's insistence on doing something
in their way may purely be because they would struggle as a result of
their autistic difficulties to do it any other way. Their way is best
for them (thus technically best for the company). 

One example of this is somebody who struggles with rigid processes and
procedures because of their autistic style of thinking and working but
manages to get to the desired outcome just as quickly and accurately in
their way. They will inevitably believe their way is the better way!

In this situation, it may be an idea for the individual to be encouraged
to create a document that explains to their colleagues and managers why
they do what they do in a certain way. Understanding the reasoning
behind somebody's way of doing something goes a long way to improving
tolerance of other people's differences. 

It could be classed as discrimination against somebody for forcing them
to do things a certain way when that way is extremely difficult or
impossible for them because of disability and another way would be
possible for them. It is important to bear this in mind when working
with individuals.

However, remind the autistic employee when you are making accommodations
for them, as they then might be more tolerant to this 'more difficult'
or even (perceived or real) less efficient way everybody else does
things.

Indeed, non-autistic people may find certain ways of doing things easier
and more efficient because of how they think and would find the autistic
person's way difficult.

**Conclusion**

As is often the case with autism in the workplace, the difficulties that
HR professionals and managers may encounter with autistic staff are more
easily resolvable than one might first think. It does however require
some real understanding of autism -- not just the label of autism, but
how they think and learn. 

The more that managers can get their heads around individuals with
autism, the better they will be at managing all their people and the
quirks that come with them. Sometimes this can be done with minimal
input from specialists like Aspiedent. However, sometimes somebody's
'autism profile' needs to be determined during a **workplace assessment** before
any solutions are likely to be found.

Note that solutions are normally cheap and simple to implement, but are
not obvious until a workplace assessment has been carried out. It is
only occasionally that the job description needs to be modified.

These solutions can help employers tap into the hidden strengths of
staff with autism and other neurodiverse conditions and therefore
provide a significant return on investment.
