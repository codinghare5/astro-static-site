**Autistic Employees: Why don't they get it? Is it not obvious?**

Autistic people can be extremely valuable employees. But sometimes their
autism can cause some unhelpful or disruptive situations for both them
and other staff. Here are six ways that autism at work can be disruptive
because the autistic person just does not understand other colleagues
and vice versa.

1.  **Literal Understanding**

Until they learn, children often misunderstand things because of literal
thinking or because of (if you think about it) the ridiculous phrases we
come out with.

How scary are the phrases 'laughing your head off', 'crying your eyes
out', or 'it's raining cats and dogs' when you can only understand them
literally?! Cue the night terrors.

Issues with literal understanding usually improve by adulthood, as the
person learns the meaning of the phrases. However, it can often still be
an issue for some autistic people in employment.

Somebody recently told me a story about somebody with Asperger\'s they
helped into a job at a local builders' merchants. There were no
problems. That is until he nearly decapitated his colleague who was
working on the ground underneath him, after he said, \'chuck all those
posts over here\' and the autistic worker did just that!

We have also had autistic people telling us they were upset because they
were being bullied at work. After further questioning, we realised that
they were misinterpreting workplace banter.

Saying to someone '*Come on you idiot*', when asking them to follow you,
is quite nasty unless the receiver of the comments understands banter
and that you said it because you find them endearing!

2.  **Politeness V Directness**

In the UK, due to the concept of politeness, we are often reluctant to
make direct orders and prefer instead to say things like '*Can you
finish this report by Friday*', or '*Do you mind passing me that book*'.
This is rather than simply '*Please finish this report by Friday*' or
'*Pass me that boo*k'.

You might have a colleague who does communicate bluntly thus come across
as rude when it is simply because they use and understand language
literally.

In most cases, autistic people would prefer it if you also simply said
what you meant and meant what you said!

3.  **Context is Fluid**

Rules of what is acceptable behaviour change with context. Autistic
people are often not good at context.

It could be that an autistic worker has not understood the differences
in context between education and the workplace, between home and work,
or between personal and professional relationships.

An autistic worker coming from education, for example, may associate
banter with going out with mates. So banter at work triggers 'with
mates' behaviour, rather than working behaviour!

Alternatively, the difference between work colleagues and fellow
students might not be picked up. Relationships between fellow students
tend to be less 'professional' than relationships fellow employees, but
not always.

4.  **(In) appropriate Behaviour **

Autistic people can present with a lack of understanding of context in
terms of boundaries at work.

The subtle differences between what is an acceptable joke within your
private group of friends or family, and what jokes are acceptable in the
workplace can be a minefield for anyone, let alone those that struggle
with their social skills.

In some cases, an autistic employee (especially a younger person) may
engage in behaviour that is unacceptable because they do not realise it
is. For example, sharing jokes of a sensitive nature. Or when someone
mentions their favourite computer game, talking excessively about this
game when they are supposed to be doing something else.

These rules are harder and more confusing for an autistic person if
other people engage in these behaviours, but only when they know they
can get away with it!

Some autistic people are unlikely to understand the context well enough
to make instinctive judgments as to whether they can get away with
something not normally acceptable - therefore being the one who
ultimately gets in trouble for it.

Alternatively an autistic person may tell a superior what other staff
members have done once they understand that they are not supposed to do
it. This causes friction with other members of staff.

5.  **Unable to 'take a hint'**

There is often no point dropping hints to colleagues that you know are
or might be autistic. Saying something like 'Your desk looks like it
needs a good clear up before our next client comes in', is likely to
result in a response like 'Yes, I agree'.

Unwritten rules in the workplace may require an employee to pick up
other people's work when they have finished their own.

However, unless this is specified somewhere, you might find an autistic
employee watching YouTube videos when they have finished their work,
rather than seeking out other people they can help.

This is normally not a sign of disrespectful behaviour; it is just that
nobody has told them that is the way of doing things!

This sort of misunderstanding can get someone who is actually more than
willing to help others a reputation for not 'pulling their weight'.

This links to 'office politics' which can be extraordinarily complex and
confusing to an autistic mind.

6.  **The Dreaded 'Office Politics'**

Most people within an organisation know that it is not a good idea to
criticise the boss or engage in certain conversations at work.

For example, most people know that a quick way to upset another
colleague or boss is to correct their errors in front of everybody else
at a meeting.

An autistic employee may not be able to understand what the problem is
with doing this. There is an error, it should be corrected. Simple.
Pointing out somebody's error was not meant to be insulting.

Unfortunately, it can be taken as insulting and it can leave an
unhelpful impression of the autistic employee on others.

Again, it could also be the case of misunderstanding context. In
education, people are encouraged to point out errors to both the teacher
and other students. All errors matter in education. In the workplace,
not so much.

Knowing what counts as an error and what does not, and what kind of
errors should be pointed out and when, generally comes naturally to most
non-autistic people.

Similarly, there is an issue of the context of the errors regarding
whether they matter or not. For some people, grammatical errors in
written documents are tantamount to career suicide. For others, only
mistakes that have a direct and measurable financial cost to the
business, for example, may really matter.

This also depends on the industry. There are many differences within and
between 'normal' people regarding what they care about, depending on
their trade or industry. A simplistic example of this is an accountant
being more concerned than a lawyer about getting his maths right, and a
lawyer being more concerned than an accountant at getting his written
material right.

Ultimately, Autistic people have to work harder not to act in
'un-politically correct' ways at work that can damage their career
prospects, so it is only fair they be given clear guidance on this, if
needed. What is obvious to others may need to be pointed out to them.

**How can we minimise disruption and get the most value out of autistic
employees? **

To get the best out of an employee who may present with these
difficulties, it is

1.  Important not to assume that they understand how their behaviour can
    be perceived and what is expected of them.

2.  Try to take what they say at face value and generally expect them to
    do the same thing.

3.  Make the rules at work clear and concise in your communications, and
    do not be afraid to tell them what you may see as obvious.

4.  Do not be afraid to explain clearly what behaviour is acceptable and
    not in which context. They will probably actually thank you for it!
