This autism research demonstrates that this specific intervention which
improves the way parents interact with their child can help children who
are having difficulty with social interaction and possibly with sensory
processing disorder. It may help clinicians tell the difference between
children who really have autism and those who are at risk of being
misdiagnosed with autism. Autism diagnosis as a way to get support is
not helpful because it tends to lead to the wrong kind of support.

autism research paper about using early intervention to improve the
interaction between a child and their parents. This reduces the risk of
young children being given an autism diagnosis.

**The controversy surrounding a 'cure' for autism **

Some people on Twitter are OUTRAGED at a recently published [autism
study](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210921/Pre-emptive-intervention-during-infancy-reduces-the-likelihood-of-autism-diagnosis.aspx),
which reports that improving the way parents interact with their babies
reduces the risk of an autism diagnosis by age 3.

The study looked at children who showed 3 of 5 early signs of autism
based on how they interacted with their parents. The children were split
into two group. One group received the standard level of intervention
they would normally receive after being identified as having early
autistic traits. The other group (and their caregivers) received the
prescribed course of therapy. 

Reactions to these types of studies from the neurodiversity movement are
not a new thing. There has been long-standing rage from some individuals
who identify as autistic against clinicians seeking to find answers when
it comes to autism.

To be fair, it is understandable that many autistic people are sceptical
or even vehemently against some of the authorities in the autism arena,
due to there being historical discrimination, misunderstanding, and
downright fraud against autistic people and their families.

Many autistic people have experienced trauma due to being subjected to
inappropriate interventions, their experiences have been invalidated,
and they have effectively been told, in a roundabout way, that their
existence is unwanted. 

Some people believe that any attempt at improving the lives of autistic
people which involves them having to adapt their behaviour in any way;
and which doesn't involve society accommodating all of the various
autistic difficulties (impossible), and feeling guilty and shamed for
being 'neurotypical', should be banned.

But there are so many other things wrong with this level of vitriol that
has been targeted at the publication of this study.

Many don't appear to understand what they are reading. I'm not sure if
they even have read what they are so readily and heavily criticising. 

The Study
---------

If they looked at the study carefully and logically (which is what my
science-minded autistic colleague did), they would find that what they
are all getting so upset about is not about a 'cure' for autism:

a)  The children in the study were not diagnosed with autism. They just
    had early signs that *might* result in a future diagnosis.

b)  The children were followed up only until age 3 and only a
    comparatively small proportion of the total number of children
    received a diagnosis at that point. It maybe that others would
    receive a future diagnosis.

c)  Nobody knows whether the children in the study who were not
    subsequently diagnosed by age 3 were actually autistic. These groups
    of children were recruited on the basis that they were identified as
    having some autistic traits! That does not necessarily mean they are
    all autistic. 

d)  Helping parents interact with their children, in general, is likely
    to be beneficial for development

e)  The invention was focused on the parents, not the child. It was
    focused on modifying the parents' behaviour not the child\'s
    behaviour. (Which is precisely what neurodiversity activists say
    they want!)

If the study is read in detail, it suggests some important findings. 

The study found statistically significant differences between the two
groups of children (the intervention group and the control group)
involved in the study with respect to the following aspects of the DSM 5
(autism diagnostic) criteria:

-   Deficits in social emotional reciprocity

-   Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects or speech

-   Sensory issues. 

That means the following were not statistically significant between the
two groups of children 

-   Deficits in nonverbal communication used for social interaction

-   Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships

-   Insistence on sameness

-   Highly restricted fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity
    or focus

The intervention seems to have had a significant impact on reducing the
child's deficits in social emotional reciprocity and/or sensory issues.
However, it does not affect some autistic difficulties. 

This makes sense because

1)  It is not just autism that causes children to have difficulties with
    social emotional reciprocity. The intervention will have help
    children with difficulties other than autism that lead to
    difficulties with social interaction.

2)  It has been found that sensory processing disorder interventions
    work best when the child is very young. Also, the [Son-Rise
    programme](https://autismtreatmentcenter.org/what-is-the-son-rise-program/)
    targets sensory issues and interactions between parent and child. 

3)  Stereotyped or repetitive motor movement and use of objects or
    speech, are linked to sensory issues. So logically, improving
    sensory issues will improve these issues too (as found in the
    study). 

It has nothing to do with making children appear less autistic
--------------------------------------------------------------

So despite the claims of the angry people on Twitter, this is nothing to
do with making children appear less autistic!

Aspiedent CIC has been researching and trying to get to the bottom of
autism for a long time now and has found that there are some core
underlying difficulties in people with autism, which are not emphasised
in the diagnostic criteria. Interestingly, it looks like these
underlying issues are not affected as a result of the study\'s
intervention. 

These are difficulties processing information, idiosyncratic ways of
thinking, and focus and interests. 

This leads to our conclusion that the intervention technique used in
this study weeds out both those who would be misdiagnosed with autism
because of difficulties with social interaction for reasons other than
autism and those who have sensory processing disorder and not autism.

It can be difficult to tell the difference between autism and sensory
processing disorder. Although research demonstrates sensory issues in
autism are not the same as sensory issues in sensory processing
disorder, the differences are subtle.

So what are all the people who state they are autistic on Twitter
worried about? Isn't helping children a good thing?! 

What this study really sheds light on, and what everybody seems to agree
on, is that seeking or getting an Autism diagnosis as a way to get
support is really not helpful. It is better to get support for the
difficulties you do have rather than the difficulties you don't have.

It would be interesting to see if all the interventions for autism that
claim to \'cure\' autism, actually turn out to cure a different
underlying disorder that has been misdiagnosed as autism, and actually
have little effect on what is understood to be autism. 

But then we are back to the question \'what is autism?\' to which there
is currently no really satisfactory answer.

As a side, people as individuals should be encouraged to modify some of
their behaviour to fit in with society and those around them. It's
called not being selfish. 

For example, I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and I would
arguably feel much better (at the time) spending 15-20 minutes doing my
rituals and checks before leaving the office every day.

However, when I have tired co-workers with me waiting to leave the
office so they can go home and get on with other stuff, I work hard to
forgo this compulsion despite it making me feel uncomfortable and
unsafe. Why? Because I care about my colleague's needs too. I adapt and
modify my behaviour.

The same reason why my severely autistic colleague allows me to tone
down her bluntness where we can, to help non autistic people who do not
know her well feel more comfortable. It\'s common courtesy. 

If I said that society had to adapt to me all the time, I'd have
everyone around me doing the most ridiculous things to satisfy my urges.
Are my friends, family, and colleagues 'ableist'. No!

It is similar to autism in that some neurodiversity activists think that
stimming (an often repetitive motion of some sort that calms an autistic
individual down) should be acceptable in public and if not then that
environment is ableist. But what about the other people there that are
easily distracted and disturbed/upset by too much movement. It just
doesn't work.
