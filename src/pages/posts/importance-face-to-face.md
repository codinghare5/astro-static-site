**The Importance of Meeting Face to Face**

Jen Blacow Operations Manager, Aspiedent CIC

Zoom call over, I shut the laptop, stand up, and my head's whirling. I
expect that, in different variations to this, I am not alone.

I have possibly interacted with more contacts in the space of two months
than ever before in that length of time! I have also had some great
conversations with great people, which I hope one day to be able to
follow up in person.

It is quite amazing that I can visit a meeting at 10am in Leeds, 11.30am
in Hertfordshire and 1pm in Canada. We are fortunate to have the
technology and infrastructure to have this option. But now I have a
tension headache, and I feel relatively empty inside.

During the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown, we have been restricted to networking
via online conferencing software, such as Zoom. While this is convenient
in some ways -- I do not have to leave my home -- I worry that it cannot
be a long-term solution.

Some people may believe that being able to see someone's face is enough.
Surely simply being able to read facial expression and body language is
all you need to communicate? Well actually, not quite.

Autism Trainer & Researcher Dr Elizabeth Guest, who right now is doing
research into autism and empathy, reliably informs me that social
interaction is really about exchanging packets of emotion.

In fact, she can see this happening when watching people interact in
person, but because of her own autism cannot emulate it herself. It is
this to and fro of emotion exchanges that build the social and emotional
connection that makes social interaction so rewarding.

She reminds me that it is impossible to transmit actual emotion over
telephone wires, fibre optic cables, and Wi-Fi. As such Zoom, and other
video conferencing software, fall short of real face to face social
interaction.

Elizabeth reckons that during our daily Zoom calls (which she avoids
like the plague -- apart from exercise classes, which don't involve
staring at the computer), we are *inferring* these packets of emotional
information from the words, facial expressions, and body language we see
during our video conferencing calls.

This is enough in the short term, but in the long-term actual meetings
in person are arguably vital.

Having to *infer* emotional information, rather than just absorb it like
we do in each other's physical presence, makes networking via Zoom more
tiring and less satisfying.

Although there is certainly a place for online networking and Zoom
meetings, I suspect that in order to build strong business (and other)
relationships, it is important to meet face to face. This is the only
way to really connect and there is no substitute for this.

Elizabeth isn't the only autistic person whose difficulties include
being unable to pass and receive these packets of emotional information
back and forth during social interaction. This is one disadvantage that
some (definitely not all) autistic businesspeople may have to realise
and mitigate against. In Aspiedent's case, I do most of the social
interaction and networking.

So, apart from the occasional Zoom fatigue and the lack of emotional
interaction, I am currently trying to make the most out of Zoom calls.
However, I will be one of the first people to turn up to a face to face
meeting or accept an invite to somebody else's office in person!
