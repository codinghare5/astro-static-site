description: There are two autism myths. One is that autism adjustments should be made so much that autistic people should never be expected to change or adapt to fit in with ‘society’. The other is that autistic people should have their autistic traits trained out of them. What connects these myths is the fact that society cannot accommodate completely to the needs of any individual. Read on for more…

Recently we came across a post on LinkedIn which contained two 'myths'
relating to autism. These were:

1.  Autistic people will succeed in life if their autism is trained out
    of them.

2.  Autistic people should never have their autistic traits trained out
    of them. They will be successful in life as who they are.

Both are (potentially dangerous) and extremely misguided half-truths.

Please note, this post has been essentially written by somebody with
autism. I am just putting it in a different format in this blog.

Let us deal with the first one:

**Myth 1: Autistic people will succeed in life if their autism is trained out of them.**

Well actually, we have been working with a young autistic woman for over
a year now who was facing a lot of barriers in her quest to get a job
and in building relationships with others.

It took us a while to work out what her underlying difficulties were,
but it turned out that she 'rote learned' everything (remembered social
phrases off by heart and then just repeated them when it was vaguely
relevant for her to do so).

This meant she appeared to be understanding what was happening in a
social situation when she had not a clue. Her processing is very slow.

The solution was quite simply to teach her how to think and how to do
problem-solving. This was done using the interests she had. She loved
the work and was well motivated.

The results which started to become visible after a few months were:

-   It became possible to have a two-way conversation with her. She was
    better able to listen and respond to what you said. Before she was
    simply picking up on keywords and phrases and then saying something
    back. This was disconcerting sometimes as she would start talking
    about something completely different than you were during a
    conversation. This gave the impression she was not listening -- not
    great in a work environment.

-   Her relationships with her family improved dramatically. They
    started inviting her round regularly rather than just occasionally.
    They started to support her.

-   She became much less rigid in her plans and much more able to change
    them as circumstances changed. As a result, she was able to move
    into much better accommodation nearer to her relatives when it
    became available.

-   She became able to benefit from a college course, learning English
    and Maths.

-   She has become able to think critically to a certain extent. Her
    ability to see the funny side of things without having it explained
    is much improved. She surprised me the other day by thinking
    critically about something the government did and explained to me
    why they were potentially misleading the public. I was in shock.
    Happy shock.

-   Linked to this, her interests have widened from very insular, basic
    things such as her daily routines of exercising and shopping, to
    much bigger things like politics and spirituality. I am starting to
    be able to have deeper conversations with her.

-   She is better able to manage her anxiety. Although she is still a
    very anxious person and perhaps will always be due to things she
    cannot change. However, she is better able to reason through a
    tricky situation and deal with it rather than go straight into panic
    mode.

We got the impression from the comments on the LinkedIn post we
mentioned above that this kind of intervention we have done would be
very much frowned upon and we should have left her \'as she was\' and
worked to change her environment and worked to educate those around her.
We were faced with accusations that we had 'changed' her autism in some
way and made her more like non-autistic people and that this is bad.

But her life is much improved as a result of our intervention and she is
much happier in so many ways. There is no way she could be successful in
life \'as she was\'.

We know we will get shot down for this by some people, but we find this
whole notion of \'disabled by society\' and that autistic people are ok
as they are and that they should not be expected to adjust to the world
around them is just as bad as the notion that all autistic people should
have their autism fully trained out of them.

This leads to the next 'myth'.

**Myth 2: Autistic people should never have their autistic traits trained out of them. They will be successful in life as who they are.**

In some ways this is true. The notion of training autism out of somebody
in some cases is absurd. For example, somebody who has over-sensitivity
to certain textures which makes them unable to stand touching things of
that certain texture, cannot train their skin or their brain to react
differently to said texture. Well, they might try, but I do not think we
are technologically or medically advanced enough yet to do such things
even if they were possible. Even if it were, it would probably be jolly
difficult and potentially take a lifetime of working on it.

I think the above myth comes from people who refuse to believe something
is 'wrong' with them - they are simply different. This does not work for
many people with autism though. A diagnosis of autism rests on the fact
(amongst other criteria) that the person has social communication
*difficulties.*

Some autistic people argue that these *difficulties* are a result of
society not understanding how the autistic person communicates, and if
they did, the autistic person would not have said difficulties. But then
if they did not have difficulties, what is the point of having a
'diagnosis' label of autism?

Somehow, I feel the people who advocate for this way of thinking would
be the very people who would be upset if they had their diagnosis of
autism stripped from them and were told they were 'normal', which is
what would essentially happen if society suddenly accommodated for all
their needs so that they did not struggle at all.

Some autistic people may like how their sensory issues affect them. But
they are the lucky ones. Many autistic people's sensory issues are not
an enjoyable aspect of their life or their autism.

Aspiedent does not 'train' people's autism out of them. Instead, we try
and help people to mitigate against the aspects of their autism they
cannot (yet, and perhaps never will) change. We help them to develop and
improve certain parts of themselves which are not impossible to change
and fit in as best they can in a world where, unfortunately, they are a
minority.

'Society' is not going to ever fully understand nor cater to every
unique individual with autism just like it does not understand and adapt
to every unique person in general. Without some sort of miracle, it is
impossible and it not going to happen. Everybody has to meet each
other's needs as best as they can and accept that not all their or
others\' needs will be met fully by others.

Society cannot accommodate for the needs of each individual when those
needs conflict with each other -- especially when it is impossible to
tell what the actual needs of an autistic individual are without asking
them. Notwithstanding the fact some people do not want to tell you about
their autism because they do not want to be singled out for 'special'
treatment. Some people also refuse to believe they are autistic, or just
simply do not know themselves.

We need some balance when dealing with such important, personal, and
sensitive issues. Some peoples' autism is so disabling they will never
have the same opportunities as others regardless of what society does to
accommodate.

Please do not get sucked into the assumption that all autistic people
are 'proud' of their autism or that all autistic people believe they are
perfectly fine as they are. Many autistic people do not go along with
this.
