**Mad, Bad, Difficult?**

*"Well, we all know what they are like, don't we? Quick to point out when we are wrong but cannot take criticism themselves!"*

*"You know how difficult she is. She has to have it her way, or it's no way"*

*"He's a bit of an oddball, isn't he?"*

These are just a few of the things you might hear people say about
autistic people, especially at work.

But let us consider these more closely:

***"Well, we all know what they are like, don't we? Quick to point out when we are wrong, but cannot take criticism themselves!"***

Just think, what if the person who is 'quick to judge' actually did not
make judgements quickly. What if they spent the time, that others in the
office spend socialising, pouring over research papers, and coming to
informed conclusions about whether a certain approach to a project was
right or not, for example.

And what if this person did not accept most of the criticisms that were
levelled at them, because they were not entirely true, and the criticism
was a result of a misunderstanding? And they would gladly accept
criticism if it were genuine and the criticism giver had a legitimate
and logical point.

***"You know how difficult she is. She has to have it her way, or it's no way"***

In this instance, what about if 'her way', was the logical way. What if
she had difficulty understanding the confusing and complex
socio-political reasons behind why particular decisions were made,
because of her extremely logical brain? And it was not just a case of
wanting it 'her way'?

***"He's a bit of an oddball, isn't he? He proper freaks me out when he stares!"***

Maybe he wears coloured glasses because he is hypersensitive to bright
lights in the office. Maybe he eats the same weird thing every day in
the same way because he is hypersensitive to the taste, smell, and
texture of most food, and maybe he stares at people across the canteen
while he sits alone because he is longing for somebody to talk to but
does not know how to initiate a conversation.

As with the above examples, many people with autism grow up being told
that they are *mad, bad, or difficult*. Sometimes even stupid. When in
fact, they are misunderstood. This can reduce confidence, burden them
with emotional baggage, and can even trigger defence mechanisms, such as
over or under confidence.

This also can cause real problems in employment.

**Essentially what can happen, is that the very qualities for which they are employed, are precisely what is causing the problem.**

For example, think about the person described above, who is ostracised
for their 'criticisms' of other people's ideas.

That might be this person's greatest asset!

Is it not a good thing to have a person who can see holes in ideas and
arguments and point them out bluntly to you before you go ahead and
waste a lot of money and resources on a project which was never going to
work?! What is so bad about that? Notwithstanding, this person's alleged
difficulty with being criticised themselves might be a misunderstanding.

And how about if the person who appears to want to have it their way all
the time (but just needs things to make logical sense), is the one that
you can always go to when you are struggling with making sense of
something, or rely on when you are not sure what decision is the right
one to make?

When you need an objective, non-emotional assessment of something, this
person can be gold.

And what if the person who 'freaks you out', is the most caring and
generous colleague you might have. Who, when you are feeling at your
most vulnerable, senses something is wrong with you, comes over, and
eventually makes you smile? All this time you never spoke to him, and it
turns out he is the nicest and most intelligent guy you have ever met.

**Taking the rough with the smooth**

There are a lot of claims from people and the media today, that many
autistic people are simply brilliant, talented, underappreciated, and
underemployed, and that companies are missing out not employing them.

I agree with the point that autistic people are underappreciated and
underemployed. In reality, autistic people can be extremely valuable
assets to companies.

But what makes them extremely valuable is precisely what can create some
difficulties for employers managing them. Making it out as any different
is both confusing (is it a disability or a difference?) and does not
help the cause for autistic people or companies alike.

If an employer wants their workforce to represent or possess a diversity
of thinking, innovation, and creativity, then they may well have to deal
with some apparently 'difficult' or 'strange' people, and the challenges
that this might create.

But if employers are trained to understand the underlying issues behind
autistic symptoms, then it is quite simple to accommodate for them (thus
getting the benefit of employees who think differently).

So for example, if an employer would value an employee who would quite
happily do the same thing every day, demonstrating a rigid adherence to
a process or boring repetitive work, then they will have to be prepared
to accommodate for when that person has major difficulty with change.

It is the old age saying: 'you can't have your cake, and eat it too'.

If you want a homogenous workforce then do not employ neurodiverse
people. But you will encounter all the problems of 'group think' (which
can arguably cause as many problems as clashes in ways of thinking and
working).

If you fancy standing out, then learning to accommodate difference (and
understand neurodiversity) is key!

This blog is therefore an introduction to a truthful series of blogs on
the difficulties employers may encounter with managing autistic
employees, along with the benefits that dealing with these difficulties
could reap.
