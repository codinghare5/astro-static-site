We discovered recently that a few people have done web searches for ‘what jobs are suitable for people with slow processing issues?’ 

In the last blog post, we discussed slow processing of incoming information.

To answer the question about jobs though, we are back to the usual answer: it depends. It depends on the type of slow processing and where the slow processing is.

It also depends on other factors such as interests, what skills the person has, and general level of intelligence, independent of how quickly the person processes incoming information. 

If you have slow processing of incoming information, you have to be careful when choosing career or study paths.

This blog post discusses possible job roles for people with slow processing of incoming information.

 

### So what kinds of jobs *might* be suitable for people with slow processing of incoming information?
If you have slow processing of incoming information, then a job where getting the detail right (attention to detail) is more important than the speed, may be best. There are jobs out there where people are prepared to pay for quality and are not worried by how long it takes because after all, they’ll end up with a better product or service. 

On the other hand, jobs that require you to work at a high speed and produce lower quality might not work. For example, jobs where you’ve got to process lots of incoming visual and auditory information quickly, but where it does not matter if you make a bit of a mess of it occasionally, might not work. 

But basically, any job which where you need attention to detail, and to do an accurate and good job might be suitable. Accurate is never quick. For anybody.

 

### Potential jobs for slow processing of incoming information
If physical ability is not an issue, then something like plastering might be suitable for a person with slow processing of incoming information. This work needs an eye for detail, and you're hanging around a bit waiting for the plaster to cure off before you go over it. Also, you need to get the detail to make sure you go over all of it.

Bespoke joinery or carpentry is another one. If you're building something out of wood, slow and accurate is the name of the game rather than speed. If you do speed, you make mistakes, and you can only cut a piece of wood once… if you’ve cut it too short you’ve kind of had it! When you’re measuring a piece of wood you do it slowly. You have to get it right.

Writing policies and legal documents needs to be done slowly and carefully and they need to make sense within the context you are writing. They also have to be clear. A policy writer or somebody who drafts the law could be a good job for somebody with slow processing of incoming information, too – as long as they have the appropriate knowledge and skills. 

If you are slow at processing incoming information, but then quick once the information is in, you may be less likely to contradict yourself within documents, as you’ll have a full picture of everything you’ve written when you’re further down the document.

Loopholes in the law due to rushed, lack of joined-up and coherent law, are probably not a good thing for a legislator.

For some people, it is verbal and/or visual information in particular that is processed slowly. If you have both slow verbal processing and slow visual processing, that will make reading very difficult. So aiming for a career in something that requires you to read a lot quickly, for example, practising the law, copywriting, or even teaching, is probably not the best idea

You would also probably not pursue a career in areas that require you to follow any written or oral instructions quickly, like in the emergency services, working in a fast-food restaurant, or even working in an Amazon warehouse. 

It may be that gardening or landscaping are good jobs for people with slow processing of information, or some types of creative work like art, design, or writing. Where people expect you to take your time. But a job that involves driving or something like train conducting may not be suitable for people with slow processing issues.

But just because you might not process words easily does not mean your auditory processing is poor… it might be better than average. In which case, being a musician who is expected to hear music and learn to play it quickly could be a good career choice. 

If you are slow at taking in information but very fast once you've got the information, then you may need a kind of job where you're given instructions rarely, and are expected to go and problem solve whatever it is you are doing. 

So, things like coding, which is fairly methodical, but where you've got a lot of problem-solving to do may be suitable.

 

### Conclusion
It easy to recognise some (not all) people who have slow processing of incoming information in how they approach giving a talk or a presentation. They may be the ones who are so prepared that they have prepared for every eventuality.

This might be so they don’t get any surprises because they can't cope with processing changes at the time they arise, or it might be a problem with not processing incoming information quickly enough to wing changes in their presentation. 

These people tend not to wing it! It can make them incredibly good at their job (they are extremely knowledgeable). 

Such people could make very good tour guides such as taking groups of people around historical building and explaining the history.

Another example we have come across is an autistic person who refuses to answer his phone and prefers text messages, because he just agrees with everything the caller says at the time.

This is likely due to not being able to work out what he wants and formulate an appropriate response quickly enough. This would make a job where he had to make or receive telephone calls impossible. 

In conclusion, jobs that generally require accuracy but which are not really time sensitive may be best for people who have slow processing of incoming information.
