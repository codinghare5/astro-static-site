major problems. However, it is often easy to fix.

**Title:** Simple Misunderstandings Major Problems

**How SIMPLE misunderstandings can cause MAJOR problems. **

When we do work for employers about autism and neurodiversity, we often
hear remarkably similar stories from employers who manage autistic
staff. Often this is in relation to the autistic person's interpersonal
skills.

We have also come across some very strange ways in which autistic people
misinterpret non autistic colleagues and manager's motives in relation
to their difficulties with social interaction.

**Here are some particularly interesting examples of ways a manager may
misunderstand an autistic employee**

One example is when an autistic employee was accused of regularly
butting in on other employee's private conversations -- which was
causing friction in the office. When we got to the bottom if it, it was
simply happening because the employee had trouble discriminating
background noise from foreground noise. Therefore they were picking up
people's private conversation from behind them and thought they were
open conversations. Solution? Move the individual away from others, or
give them earphones to wear!

Sometimes, managers and colleagues may think an autistic employee is not
a team player because they never stay behind to do overtime, for
example. But what they do not realise is that often, autistic people are
just unable to take subtle hints. They cannot just take the hint that
they should do it from the fact others are doing it. They need asking
directly to do the overtime, in which they case they probably will do so
very willingly!

Finally, an autistic person who is hypersensitive to smell may feel like
they are eating the persons perfume or aftershave when they are near
them. This may make it seem like they do not like certain random people,
or have a problem with working with certain people (the ones who wear
scents). When in fact, it is purely because they cannot cope with the
scent. If managers and staff understand this, then their tolerance of
the persons avoidance of them should be far greater!

As with all thing autism, it works both ways (autistic people
misinterpret the motivations behind non autistic people). Here are some
examples of this...

**Ways that an autistic person may not understand a manager**

Linked to this, an autistic person may assume that their Boss is a
pushover, because he decides not to pay himself a bonus after a bad
year, but gives his employees their bonuses as normal. Because they see
the surface in an extremely simplistic way, they may misinterpret this
as weakness on their boss's behalf, when in fact it is a very honourable
thing to do. If they are a logical thinker, it may need to be pointed
out to the employee that doing this means the boss's employees will most
likely stay with him for longer, saving him money long term and thus
helping avoid the business going under.

We have come across autistic people who have quite black and white
understandings of their managers of colleagues. For example, if their
manager is difficult to deal with, they might instantly put them in the
box of 'sociopath'. This is down to an extremely limited understanding
of other people, and their motivations behind how they might act. The
person may just need basic help in understanding that people are often
not that simple!

Furthermore, an autistic person might have an overly simplistic view of
people's actions. They may, after struggling to build relationships at
work, have seen another colleague bringing flowers for somebody, which
was extremely well received.

This autistic person might have difficulty understanding that context in
the social world is important. They then might start bringing in flowers
for people regularly, in aid of being kind and well liked. That is,
until they are hauled off to HR because the colleagues who keep
receiving the flowers are misinterpreting it as harassment!

Finally, an autistic person might get terribly upset with colleagues
because they do not have the social skills to manage banter. They may
misinterpret somebody genuinely trying to build a relationship with
them, as bullying them. This can cause all sorts of problems, when in
fact the non-autistic colleague was trying to be friendly.

Essentially, all of the above issues are misunderstandings of the
underlying reasons behind why someone might be acting the way they are.

Most, if not all, of these 'major' problems, are actually not complex
and can be easily solved through a better mutual understanding of
people's motives. This applies both to autistic and non-autistic
employees.
