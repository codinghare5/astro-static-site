Have you ever wondered about yourself, your partner, or your colleague and thought they might be 'on the spectrum'? If so, or if you are simply curious to find out more, this entertaining and informative talk is ideal for you.

Autism is a vast subject. Autism is an umbrella term which groups a large number of different difficulties under one label. This is why autistic people are so varied. This presentation uses cartoons, diagrams and pictures to give a short overview of the variation within autism along with a look at the social-communication difficulties which are likely to occur.

This session is an introduction to Aspiedent's autism and neurodiversity profiling tool. This tool is innovative and unique. This tool gets behind the symptoms to the underlying issues that cause the symptoms. When you understand the specific autism of the individual, it is much easier to devise tailored accommodations for the specific individual.

Attending this workshop will give you an overview of autism that might give you insights into yourself, your relationships, and your work environment that will help you in multiple ways.

It should whet your appetite to find out more and we would love to see on one of our other training sessions. Feel free to tell us what you would like.
