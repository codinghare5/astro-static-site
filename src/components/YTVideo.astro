			<p>
				Aspiedent has been in business since 2014. Established by Dr Elizabeth Guest (BSc, PhD, PGCHE), she was soon joined by Operations Manager and HR Practicioner, Jen Blacow.
				Both have one goal in mind: to make a positive difference to the world of work for all.
				Both Elizabeth and Jen happen to be disabled. 
				Elizabeth has autism, dyslexia and ADHD;
				Jen has OCD.
				We understand the issues that simple misunderstandings (on both sides) can cause.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both Dr Guest and Jen work with autistic and neurodiverse people. 
				Our experiences and expertise help take the fear or stress out of managing autistic or 
				neurodivergent employees.
